# music-player-basic
i.e. a music player widget that can be injected in any site. *(made this with tumblr in mind)*

## Disclaimer
Created this for personal use only tbh. You can get inspired though,,,

## Set Up
I've generally note down where to put certain parts into the HTML file.
This is meant to complement an already themed Tumblr page or website. Kind of.
